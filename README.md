AdeolaAkinfaderin_Pharmacy_InsightChallenge submission

The input is the url to the raw file on the insight pharmacy counting github page
The src is my python code used to arrive at the desired output. Python 3 was utilized and no external libraries were used as instructed.
The output file is a sample of the output after running my code.

I am not familiar with shell scripting or github, so I may have messed up the set up for Github. But you should be able to run the code using any IDE with python 3.

Thank you
Adeola Akinfaderin
